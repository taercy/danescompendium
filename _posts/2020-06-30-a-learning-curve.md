Well, it's ten minutes until seven in the morning. I have been trying to get this to work for about two hours now, but part of that was taking the course on how to get a GitHub Pages running. I don't know what a reasonable goal to set is in terms of learning this tool, as it seems like I'm going to be learning HTML and JS and anything else I may want to learn for this site to be a passion project. Honestly right now as long as I post a daily blog post or something documenting my progress I am happy. This post will serve for today even though it's the morning as of the first draft. Maybe later I will come back to the post and add more with a timestamp. 

My biggest issue right now is the layouts. I have no idea what to do but it is only showing the index file's contents and a Times New Roman list of posts. It basically looks like the HTML didn't load, which makes sense because there isn't any. I guess I would have to create a layout from scratch for it to be there. Makes sense. I wish there was a better method of learning the defaults of stuff from the tutorial. They showed me the "minima" theme which seemed simple enough to fit my needs right now, but I think the layout I added is breaking it. I may end up deleting the file just to see if that changes anything. **UPDATE**: The custom layout file broke the theme. That was the issue. Maybe I will look into making my own custom theme, but minima works right now for just journal entries

I don't know whether or not this will line break for me or if it will go off into the void. I guess that's another part of learning this. Markdown is a pretty handy language. I am glad I was exposed to it during the term here instead of right now, as it would be much harder to wrap my head around if it was a brand new concept. **UPDATE**: I looked at the post after the first draft and it does line break, there's an option in the top right of the GitHub file editor that allows for a soft wrap. Seems simple enough. 

It blows me away that I wasn't learning this stuff at JWU. It seems almost devious or intentionally detrimental to not show the students something like this and familiarize them with it early on. This is how every student should be handing in work forever. I don't care if it takes longer to learn how to use, if the teacher creates a template for the homework then students could submit it in the same format every time and it would be easy to grade and make the work look better too. It is also easier to use that Microsoft Word and faster due to templating and other layout tools. I just have to learn how to use them. 

Oh well. I should go back to sleep for a little while. Any progress is more progress than I was making at home, playing games and sleeping the day away. At least now I have something to show for time spent and it will be a little bit more impressive than a fake number going up. 

Signing off, 

Dan
